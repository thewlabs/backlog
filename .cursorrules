## 1. Project Structure and Navigation
1.1 Always check the project structure in `AGENTS.md` before making changes
1.2 Follow the directory structure under `.backlog/` (see [Project Structure](./AGENTS.md#structure))
- Never modify files outside the designated project directories
- Always verify file locations before making changes

## 2. Task Management
- Always check .backlog/tasks/ for current tasks before starting work
- Reference task IDs in all commit messages and PR titles
- Follow the task status workflow defined in config.yml
- Never modify task files directly - use the backlog CLI commands
- When creating new tasks, ensure they follow the established format
- Subtasks must use decimal numbering (e.g., task-4.1) to indicate their parentage.
- Subtasks are created using the CLI with the --parent <task-id> flag; the next decimal ID is assigned automatically.
- Always reference subtasks by their full decimal ID in commit messages, PR titles, and documentation.
- Subtasks are stored in the same .backlog/tasks/ directory as main tasks.
- After completing and testing a task, set its status to Done via CLI:

```bash
backlog task edit <task-id> --status Done
```

## 3. Documentation
3.1 All documentation must be in Markdown format
3.2 Update relevant `readme.md` files when making changes
3.3 Document architectural decisions in `.backlog/decisions/`
3.4 Maintain clear and concise documentation
3.5 Include examples in documentation where appropriate 

## 4. Code Quality and Testing
- Ensure all code changes are properly tested
- Follow the project's coding style and conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include appropriate error handling
- Add comments for complex logic

## 5. Git Workflow
- Always check git status before committing
- Use branch names that reflect the task being worked on (tasks/<task-id> feature description)
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference task IDs in commit messages

## 6. AI Agent Guidelines
6.1 Always verify task requirements before implementation
6.2 Use semantic search to understand existing code
6.3 Check for similar implementations before creating new features
6.4 Document any assumptions in PR descriptions and `.backlog/decisions/`
6.5 Consider edge cases and error scenarios

## 7. Configuration Management
- Never modify config.yml directly
- Use backlog config commands for configuration changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document configuration changes in decisions/

## 8. Review and Communication
- Ensure all changes are properly documented
- Verify that changes don't break existing functionality
- Check for potential security implications
- Consider performance impact of changes
- Validate against project requirements
- Use clear and professional language in comments and documentation
- Document any questions or concerns in task comments
- Keep commit messages and PR descriptions informative
- Reference relevant documentation when making changes

## 9. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement proper error handling for all new features
- Include appropriate logging
- Consider user experience in error scenarios
- Document error cases and recovery procedures

## 10. Performance and Security
- Consider performance implications of changes
- Optimize code when necessary
- Document performance considerations
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Follow security best practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Consider potential security implications
- Document security-related decisions

## 11. Maintenance and Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Remove deprecated code
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document maintenance procedures
- Document all new dependencies
- Justify dependency additions
- Consider impact on project size
- Check for license compatibility

## 12. Accessibility and Internationalization
- Ensure all features are accessible
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Test with accessibility tools
- Document accessibility considerations
- Support multiple languages where appropriate
- Use proper character encoding
- Consider cultural differences
- Document internationalization requirements

## 13. Version Control and Releases
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document breaking changes
- Maintain changelog
- Tag releases appropriately

## 14. Emergency Procedures
- Document emergency procedures
- Know how to rollback changes
- Have backup procedures
- Document recovery steps

## 15. Project-Specific Rules
- Follow Backlog.md CLI conventions
- Use proper task status transitions
- Maintain task history
- Follow project naming conventions
- Use appropriate labels for tasks
- Keep task descriptions clear and complete
- Include a `## Description` section and `## Acceptance Criteria` checklist in each task
- Write relevant tests when implementing new functionality or fixing bugs
- Follow the established workflow
- Use proper task prioritization
- Maintain task dependencies
- Follow project branching strategy

## 16. Definition of Done
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Implement necessary tests and verify they pass.
- Update relevant documentation.
- Add "## Implementation Notes" section to the task with key technical details, architectural decisions, and important changes made during implementation.
- Mark the task as done with the Backlog CLI.

## 17. Glossary
- Add a glossary of project-specific terms and acronyms
- Add "Subtask" entry: decimal numbering, CLI creation, referencing, and storage

## 18. Templates and Examples
- Add a `docs/` directory for guides (onboarding, semantic search, coding style, etc.)
- Automate rule enforcement where possible (e.g., with pre-commit hooks, CI checks)
- Regularly review and update rules to reflect project evolution and lessons learned
