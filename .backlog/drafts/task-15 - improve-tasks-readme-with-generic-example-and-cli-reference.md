## Description

Update `.backlog/tasks/README.md` so the task example demonstrates a generic template rather than the current specific example. Include a section listing all task-related CLI commands with a short description for each.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Generic task template replaces the old example
- [ ] `backlog task` commands documented (`create`, `list`, `edit`, `view`, `archive`, `demote`)
- [ ] Task committed to repository
