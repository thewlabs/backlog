## Description
`backlog board view` fails on Windows with an error similar to:
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\a\Backlog.md\Backlog.md\node_modules\blessed\usr\xterm'
```
The compiled CLI looks for blessed's terminfo files relative to the build path. When installed globally, this path does not exist. Disable blessed's Tput initialization by passing `tput: false` when creating screens so board and other UI screens work without terminfo files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All `blessed.screen` calls use `{ tput: false }`
- [x] Windows build runs `backlog board view` without ENOENT errors
- [x] Tests updated and passing

## Implementation Notes
- Disabled `Tput` in every screen creation to avoid missing terminfo files on Windows.
- Updated `line-wrapping.test.ts` to pass `{ tput: false }` when creating screens.
- Verified the board view works on Windows without ENOENT errors.
- UPDATE: The migration to bblessed (github:context-labs/bblessed) provides better cross-platform support and eliminates the need for terminfo patches entirely.
