## Description

Windows builds fail when board view tries to load built-in terminfo. Initialize blessed program with tput:false

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All TUI screens create a program with `{ tput: false }` and pass it to `blessed.screen()`
- [x] Windows binary runs `backlog board view` without ENOENT or isAlt errors
- [x] Tests updated to reflect new initialization

## Implementation Notes
- Wrap screen initialization in helper to reuse across modules
