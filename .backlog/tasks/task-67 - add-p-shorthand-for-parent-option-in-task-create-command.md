## Description

Add support for using -p as a shorthand alias for --parent when creating tasks. This will improve the CLI usability by allowing users to specify parent tasks more quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `-p` option works as an alias for `--parent` in the `task create` command
- [x] Both `backlog task create "Task title" -p task-5` and `backlog task create "Task title" --parent task-5` produce the same result
- [x] Help text shows `-p` as the shorthand for `--parent`
- [x] Existing `--parent` functionality remains unchanged
- [x] Tests are added to verify both options work correctly

## Implementation Notes

- Added `-p` as a shorthand for `--parent` in the task create command (src/cli.ts:243)
- The implementation was straightforward - simply updated the option definition to include both the shorthand and long form
- Created comprehensive test suite in `src/test/cli-parent-shorthand.test.ts` that verifies:
  - The `-p` shorthand creates subtasks with the correct parent
  - Both `-p` and `--parent` produce identical results
  - The help text correctly displays the shorthand option
- The test subtask (task-67.1) was successfully created using the new `-p` option to verify functionality
