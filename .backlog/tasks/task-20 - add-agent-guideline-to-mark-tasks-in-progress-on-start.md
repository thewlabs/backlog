## Description

Update the AI agent guideline files to ensure that whenever an agent starts working on a task they immediately mark the task as **In Progress**, assign it to themselves, and push the change.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `AGENTS.md` mentions setting status to `In Progress`, assigning the task, and pushing.
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` mentions the same instruction.
- [x] `.cursorrules` mentions the same instruction.
- [x] Task committed to repository.

## Implementation Notes

* Added new guideline bullet in `AGENTS.md` instructing agents to set the task to `In Progress`, assign themselves, and push when beginning work.
* Mirrored the same instruction in `CLAUDE.md:41` under **AI Agent Integration** section.
* Updated `.cursorrules` within the Project-Specific Rules section to include the requirement.
* All three files now consistently instruct agents to mark tasks as "In Progress" and assign themselves when starting work.
* This ensures proper task tracking and prevents multiple agents from working on the same task simultaneously.
* Implementation follows the established pattern of maintaining consistency across all agent instruction files.
