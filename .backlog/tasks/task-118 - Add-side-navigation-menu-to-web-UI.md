## Description

Add a collapsible side navigation menu to the web UI that provides access to different sections of the application. The menu should include the Kanban board (default view), Documentation, and Decisions sections. This will transform the current single-page layout into a more structured multi-section application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a side navigation component with collapsible/expandable functionality
- [ ] Include navigation items for: Kanban Board (default), Documentation, Decisions
- [ ] Implement React Router or similar routing solution for navigation
- [ ] Highlight the active section in the navigation menu
- [ ] Make the side menu responsive - collapse to icon-only on mobile
- [ ] Persist menu state (expanded/collapsed) in localStorage
- [ ] Update the main layout to accommodate the side navigation
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between sections

## Technical Notes

- Consider using React Router for client-side routing
- The side navigation should be a persistent component across all views
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with the existing UI
- Icon suggestions: Board icon for Kanban, Document icon for Documentation, Decision/Scale icon for Decisions
