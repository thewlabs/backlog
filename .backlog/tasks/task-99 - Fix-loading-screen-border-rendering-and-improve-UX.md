## Description

Fixed multiple UX issues with the loading screen component in the Backlog.md CLI tool:

1. **Windows compatibility**: Loading screen wasn't appearing on Windows due to terminal blocking during heavy async operations
2. **Missing right border**: Content was overlapping and overwriting the right border of loading boxes
3. **Poor spacing**: Text was attached directly to borders, reducing readability
4. **Height issues**: Loading boxes were taller than necessary for the content they displayed
5. **Text wrapping**: Long messages were wrapping to new lines in narrow boxes
6. **Missing spinner**: Added animated spinner to title bar to show activity

These issues were affecting the user experience across different platforms and making the loading screens less polished and functional.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Right border is fully visible and not overwritten by content
- [x] Loading screen has appropriate compact height that matches content
- [x] Spinner animation appears in title bar showing activity
- [x] Content has generous spacing from borders for better readability
- [x] Long messages do not wrap to new lines in the loading box
- [x] Loading screen appears on backlog board command with progress updates
- [x] Windows terminal compatibility with proper rendering timing
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix Windows terminal blocking**: Change `setImmediate` to `setTimeout` with small delay to allow terminal rendering
2. **Diagnose border rendering issue**: Investigate why right border disappears with content
3. **Fix content positioning**: Ensure content doesn't overlap borders by constraining width and positioning
4. **Add title spinner**: Move spinner animation from box content to title bar
5. **Optimize spacing and sizing**: Adjust heights, widths, and padding for better UX
6. **Test cross-platform compatibility**: Verify fixes work on both Windows and Unix systems

## Implementation Notes

**Root cause**: Content was overlapping right border due to improper width calculations.

**Key changes**:
- Changed `setImmediate` to `setTimeout(resolve, 10)` for Windows compatibility (lines 205, 275)
- Fixed content positioning: `left: 2, width: "100%-6"` to prevent border overlap (lines 192-194, 261-263)
- Increased box widths to 60-70 chars to prevent text wrapping
- Reduced heights to 5-6 rows for compact display
- Moved spinner to title bar using `loadingBox.setLabel()`

**Files**: `/src/ui/loading.ts`
