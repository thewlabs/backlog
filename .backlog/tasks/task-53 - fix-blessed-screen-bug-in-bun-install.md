## Description

Global install via `bun add -g backlog.md` results in a runtime error:
`TypeError: blessed.screen is not a function`. The init command fails
because the optional blessed dependency does not load correctly when the
CLI is executed with Bun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Installing the package globally with Bun runs `backlog init` without errors
- [x] Tests cover Bun execution path for loading blessed
- [x] Documentation explains Bun global install support

## Implementation Notes
Fixed loadBlessed() to prefer dynamic import which works under Bun.
Updated README with note about Bun global install.
Added regression test for blessed prompt (line-wrapping).

### Update:
The migration to bblessed (github:context-labs/bblessed) further improves Bun compatibility as it's specifically designed for Bun's runtime and module system.
