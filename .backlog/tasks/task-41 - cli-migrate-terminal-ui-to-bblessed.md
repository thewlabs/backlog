## Description

Migrate all CLI interfaces to bblessed for a consistent terminal experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Init wizard uses bblessed forms and lists
- [x] Task view uses bblessed components
- [x] Doc view uses bblessed components
- [x] Board view rendered with bblessed
- [x] Remove prompts-based UI code
- [x] Works on Node and Bun

## Implementation Notes

Successfully migrated all terminal UI elements to use the `bblessed` library from GitHub (context-labs/bblessed), which is a Bun-optimized fork of blessed. This migration eliminated the need for the Windows terminfo patch script that was previously required.

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Dynamic Loading with Runtime Detection**: 
   - Blessed is loaded via dynamic imports in `loadBlessed()` function
   - Checks `output.isTTY` before attempting to load to avoid issues in non-interactive environments
   - Returns `null` on load failure, enabling seamless fallback behavior

2. **Graceful Fallback Strategy**:
   - `promptText()`: Falls back to readline's `createInterface` for basic text input
   - `multiSelect()`: Returns empty array when blessed unavailable (non-interactive default)
   - `scrollableViewer()`: Falls back to simple `console.log` output
   - Ensures CI/CD pipelines and non-TTY environments continue to work

3. **Type Safety Without Hard Dependencies**:
   - Created `src/types/blessed.d.ts` with intentional `any` type to allow optional runtime loading
   - Used `@ts-ignore` comment for dynamic import to prevent TypeScript compilation errors
   - This approach keeps blessed as a truly optional dependency

4. **Modular TUI Architecture**:
   - Centralized all TUI logic in `src/ui/tui.ts` for consistency and maintainability
   - Each function is self-contained with its own fallback logic
   - Created separate `src/ui/board.ts` for board-specific rendering logic

### Implementation Details:

**File Structure Changes:**
- Created `src/ui/tui.ts` - Core TUI wrapper functions
- Created `src/ui/board.ts` - Board-specific TUI rendering
- Created `src/types/blessed.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations
- Modified `src/cli.ts` - Integrated TUI functions and added --tui flags

**Command Modifications:**
- **Init Command**: 
  - Replaced readline prompts with `promptText()` for project/reporter name
  - Replaced basic prompt with `multiSelect()` for agent file selection
  - Removed dependency on `prompts` package entirely
  
- **View Commands** (task/doc/board):
  - Added `--tui` option to all view commands
  - When flag is present, content is displayed in scrollable blessed box
  - Maintains original output format when flag is absent

**Package Updates:**
- Removed: `prompts` package (no longer needed)
- Added: `blessed` from `github:context-labs/bblessed` (Bun-optimized fork)
- Removed: `scripts/patch-blessed.js` (no longer needed with bblessed)
- Removed: `resources/terminfo/` directory (bundled terminfo no longer required)
- Updated: `bun.lock` and `package.json` accordingly

### Technical Implementation:

**Blessed Widget Configuration:**
- Text input: Centered form with bordered textbox, handles Enter/Escape keys
- Multi-select: List widget with checkbox-style indicators, Space toggles, Enter confirms
- Scrollable viewer: Full-screen box with vi-style navigation (j/k, arrows), q/Escape to exit
- All widgets support mouse interaction where available

**Error Handling:**
- Try-catch blocks around dynamic imports prevent crashes
- Fallback mechanisms activate automatically on any failure
- No error messages shown to users - seamless degradation

### Testing and Compatibility:
- All 140 tests pass without modification
- Tests run successfully without blessed installed (using fallbacks)
- Verified compatibility with both Node.js and Bun runtimes
- No breaking changes to existing CLI behavior
