## Description

Create interactive Kanban board using React and shadcn/ui. This will be the main view for users to visualize and manage their tasks in a familiar Kanban-style interface.

## Component Design

### Board Component Requirements

**Component Interface:**

- Accept tasks array with metadata
- Accept status configuration from project config
- Handle task movement between columns
- Handle task click for detail view

### Features

#### 1. Drag and Drop

- Use `@dnd-kit/sortable` for smooth drag-and-drop
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Snap-to-column behavior
- Touch support for mobile devices

#### 2. Task Cards

Each task card will display:

- Task ID (e.g., task-42)
- Task title
- Assignee avatar/initials
- Priority indicator (color-coded)
- Label badges
- Subtask count (if applicable)

#### 3. Column Layout

- Dynamic columns based on configured statuses
- Column headers with task counts
- Horizontal scrolling for many columns
- Column width constraints for readability

#### 4. Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Multi-column horizontal layout
- **Tablet**: Scrollable columns with touch support
- **Mobile**: Stacked vertical layout with collapsible columns

### UI Components (shadcn/ui)

- `Card` - For task cards and column containers
- `Badge` - For labels and status indicators
- `Avatar` - For assignee display
- `ScrollArea` - For column content scrolling
- `Skeleton` - For loading states

### State Management Requirements

**Data Fetching:**

- Load tasks from `/api/tasks` endpoint
- Handle loading, error, and success states
- Support data refetching when needed

**Task Updates:**

- Implement optimistic updates for drag operations
- Rollback changes on API error
- Provide clear error feedback to user

### Performance Optimizations

- Virtual scrolling for large task lists
- Memoized task cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimistic updates for drag operations
- Debounced API calls for moves

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Focus management during interactions
- High contrast mode support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Board displays tasks grouped by status
- [x] Drag and drop functionality works
- [x] Tasks show title ID and assignee
- [x] Board is responsive on mobile
- [x] Loading and error states handled
