## Description

Add commands for finalizing and moving tasks:

- `backlog task archive <task-id>` and `backlog draft archive <task-id>`
- `backlog draft promote` (move a draft to tasks)
- `backlog task demote` (move a task back to drafts)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Archived tasks are moved to `.backlog/archive/` with history preserved.
- [x] Promote/demote commands relocate files between drafts and tasks.
- [x] Commits clearly state the action performed.
