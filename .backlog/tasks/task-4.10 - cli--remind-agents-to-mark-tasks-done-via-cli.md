## Description

Update agent guidelines so that after implementing and testing a task, they use the backlog CLI to set the task status to **Done**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation instructs agents to run `backlog task edit <task-id> --status Done` after testing.
- [ ] Example usage included in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and .cursorrules files
