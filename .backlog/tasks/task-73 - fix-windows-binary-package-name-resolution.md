## Description
`backlog board view` fails on Windows with:
```
Binary package not installed for win32-x64.
```
The CLI wrapper computes the package name using `process.platform` directly, producing `backlog.md-win32-x64`. However the published package for Windows is `backlog.md-windows-x64`. Add a mapping so Windows uses the correct package name.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CLI resolves `backlog.md-windows-x64` on Windows and spawns the binary successfully.
- [x] Tests cover the platform mapping logic.
- [x] Release workflow includes any new script files.

## Implementation Notes
- Added resolveBinary.cjs to map win32 to windows and exported helpers
- Updated cli.cjs to use resolveBinaryPath for selecting binary
- Modified release workflow to package resolveBinary.cjs
- Created unit tests for getPackageName mapping
