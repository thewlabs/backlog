## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Users can add implementation notes when marking task as done
- [x] --notes flag accepts multi-line text
- [x] Implementation notes are saved to task file under ## Implementation Notes section
- [x] Command works with status update: backlog task edit <id> -s Done --notes 'notes here'
- [x] Notes are appended if section already exists

## Implementation Plan

1. Add --notes flag to task edit command parser
2. Parse and validate notes input
3. Implement logic to add/update Implementation Notes section in task content
4. Ensure notes work with status updates (especially when marking as Done)
5. Handle multi-line notes properly
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Update CLI help documentation
