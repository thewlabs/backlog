## Description

Goal: Make checkbox lists flush-left and tidy.

Detailed work:
- During markdown-to-UI transform, replace "- [x] " / "- [ ] " with " [x] " / " [ ] " (or another padding scheme you prefer)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All checklist lines start at the same column (snapshot diff)
- [x] Regex unit test passes for both checked and unchecked cases
