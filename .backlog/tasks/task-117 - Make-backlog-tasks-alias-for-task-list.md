## Description

Currently, `backlog tasks` is an alias for the `task` command. This should be changed to be an alias for `backlog task list` instead, providing a more intuitive shortcut for listing all tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Change `backlog tasks` to be an alias for `backlog task list`
- [ ] Remove the current alias that makes `backlog tasks` point to `task`
- [ ] Ensure help text reflects the updated alias behavior
- [ ] Test that `backlog tasks` shows the task list with all filtering options available
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility - existing scripts using `backlog task` should still work

## Technical Notes

The CLI alias configuration needs to be updated in the CLI definition to redirect `tasks` to `task list` instead of just `task`.
