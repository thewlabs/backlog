## Description

Successfully migrated from the original blessed library to bbblessed (github:node-opcua/bbblessed), a fork with improved bundling support that eliminates the need for complex Windows patches and provides better cross-platform compatibility.

## Background

The project previously used blessed v0.1.81 with a custom patch script (`scripts/patch-blessed.js`) that:
1. Replaced dynamic widget loading with static imports for Bun bundling
2. Bundled terminfo files and patched tput.js for Windows compatibility

This patching was fragile and a maintenance burden.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Replace blessed with bblessed in package.json
- [x] Remove postinstall patch script
- [x] Remove patch-blessed.js and terminfo resources
- [x] All tests pass with bblessed
- [x] Board view and other TUI components work correctly
- [x] Windows binary builds without patches
- [x] No regression in functionality

## Implementation Details

### Migration Steps Completed:
1. Installed bbblessed from GitHub: `npm install github:node-opcua/bbblessed`
2. Removed postinstall script from package.json
3. Deleted `scripts/patch-blessed.js`
4. Deleted `resources/terminfo/` directory
5. Updated all imports from `import blessed from "blessed"` to `import blessed from "bbblessed"`
6. Verified all tests pass (229/229)
7. Tested board view and other TUI functionality

### Key Benefits:
- **No more patches**: bbblessed has improved bundling support with recent commits specifically addressing bundling issues
- **Better Windows support**: Cross-platform compatibility built-in
- **Improved bundling**: Specific fixes for bundling issues (Sept 2024 commits)
- **Cleaner setup**: No postinstall scripts or resource files needed
- **Same API**: Drop-in replacement, no code changes required
- **Active maintenance**: bbblessed is actively maintained with recent bundling improvements

### Technical Notes:
- The library is now imported as `bbblessed` in all source files
- Version 0.1.82 includes bundling improvements from Sept 2024
- **Windows Fix**: Enhanced `createScreen()` in tui.ts to handle Windows terminfo issues:
  - Only disables tput on Windows (works normally on Mac/Linux)
  - Sets `tput: false`, `termcap: false`, `extended: false` on program creation
  - Forces `terminal: 'dumb'` on Windows to prevent terminfo detection
  - Provides minimal tput stubs with common escape sequences for Windows
  - Works around bbblessed bugs where it incorrectly uses `this.put` instead of `this.tput.strings`
  - Adds required methods like `csr()` and `enacs()` that bbblessed expects
  - This completely prevents the `ENOENT: no such file or directory` terminfo errors on Windows
  - Windows users still get full TUI with colors, boxes, and all features

### Related Tasks Updated:
