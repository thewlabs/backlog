# Decisions

Team decisions regarding architecture/technologies.
They are not tasks but rather decisions that guide the development process.
They may include choices about frameworks, libraries, or design patterns.

Create a new decision log with `backlog decision create <title>` and list all decisions with `backlog decision list`.
