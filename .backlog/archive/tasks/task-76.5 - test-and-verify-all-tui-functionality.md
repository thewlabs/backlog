## Description

Comprehensively test all Terminal User Interface (TUI) functionality to ensure the migration to neo-neo-blessed has not introduced any regressions or broken features.

Testing should cover:
- All interactive UI components and views
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Mouse interaction (if supported)
- Screen rendering and layout
- Performance and responsiveness
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test board view navigation and task selection
- [ ] Verify task viewer displays all content correctly
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (q to quit, arrow keys, enter, etc.)
- [ ] Verify list scrolling and pagination work correctly
- [ ] Test task creation and editing flows in TUI
- [ ] Verify color rendering and styling are preserved
- [ ] Test on multiple terminal emulators (iTerm, Terminal.app, etc.)
- [ ] Verify TUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Test with different terminal sizes and resizing
- [ ] Ensure no visual artifacts or rendering issues
- [ ] Run existing UI tests and ensure they pass
- [ ] Document any behavioral differences found

## Migration Cancellation Note

This task has been cancelled. After assessment (task 76.1), it was determined that neo-neo-blessed does not support ESM modules, which contradicts its main selling point. The migration to neo-neo-blessed has been abandoned in favor of continuing with the current blessed implementation.
