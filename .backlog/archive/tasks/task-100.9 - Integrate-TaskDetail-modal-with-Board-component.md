## Description

Connect the Kanban board task cards with the TaskDetail modal for viewing full task information. This integration ensures users can seamlessly view task details directly from the board interface.

## Integration Requirements

### Modal State Management
- Add modal state management to Board component or parent container
- Handle opening/closing TaskDetail modal
- Manage selected task state for modal display
- Ensure proper cleanup when modal closes

### Task Card Click Handling
- Make task cards clickable throughout the entire card area
- Provide visual feedback on hover (cursor pointer, subtle highlight)
- Prevent modal opening during drag operations
- Handle both click and keyboard navigation (Enter key)

### Data Flow
- Pass selected task data to TaskDetail component
- Fetch complete task content when modal opens
- Handle loading states while fetching task details
- Update board when task is edited from modal

### User Experience
- Smooth modal animations (fade in/out)
- Proper focus management when modal opens/closes
- Escape key closes modal
- Click outside modal closes it
- Prevent body scroll when modal is open

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load TaskDetail component when first needed
- Avoid re-fetching task data if already loaded
- Memoize task detail content when possible

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clicking task card opens TaskDetail modal
- [ ] Modal displays complete task information
- [ ] Modal can be closed properly
- [ ] Board remains functional behind modal
- [ ] Task updates from modal reflect on board
